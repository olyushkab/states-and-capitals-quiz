# states-and-capitals-quiz
This program gives you the list of states and capitals sorted by state or by capital and then checks your knowledge providing final result at the end.


Developed a Java program that uses a two-dimensional array to store 50 U.S. states and their capitals.
Implemented a bubble sort algorithm to sort the array of state-capital pairs based on the capitals' names.
Created a quiz game where the user is prompted to enter the capital for each state, and the program checks the answers and displays the total number of correct answers.
